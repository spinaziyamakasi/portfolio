-- Widget: "Farthest shipments" table -- the 10 orders that traveled the
-- longest distance from seller to customer.
--
-- The `geolocation` table maps zip_code_prefix -> lat/lng -- but NOT
-- one-to-one. Each zip prefix has multiple sampled rows (real GPS pings
-- within that area), so joining straight from orders to geolocation would
-- multiply every order's rows by however many geolocation samples share
-- that zip -- silently wrong, not an error. Use a CTE to collapse
-- geolocation down to one row per zip prefix FIRST (its average lat/lng is
-- fine), THEN join orders to that clean version. This is the textbook case
-- for a CTE: not because a subquery couldn't do it, but because naming the
-- intermediate step makes the "one row per zip" invariant explicit instead
-- of silently assumed three joins later.
--
-- Distance: use the haversine formula (great-circle distance on a sphere).
-- In Postgres:
--   6371 * acos(
--     cos(radians(lat1)) * cos(radians(lat2)) * cos(radians(lng2 - lng1))
--     + sin(radians(lat1)) * sin(radians(lat2))
--   )
-- gives distance in km, where 6371 is Earth's radius in km. Wrap the acos()
-- argument in LEAST(1.0, ...) -- floating-point rounding can occasionally
-- push it a hair above 1.0 for very short distances, which makes acos()
-- return NULL instead of ~0. Round the final result to 1 decimal place.
--
-- Some orders have multiple order_items (possibly from different sellers).
-- Pick exactly one seller per order for this -- DISTINCT ON (order_id) in a
-- CTE is a clean way to do that deterministically.
--
-- Expected columns: order_id, distance_km
-- Expected order: distance_km DESC
-- Expected row count: 10 -- FETCH FIRST 10 ROWS ONLY, not LIMIT.
--
-- Once this works: try EXPLAIN ANALYZE on it. geolocation is the largest
-- table in this schema by a wide margin -- not graded, but worth seeing
-- what a join against ~1M ungrouped rows actually costs, and whether an
-- index on geolocation's zip column changes anything.
